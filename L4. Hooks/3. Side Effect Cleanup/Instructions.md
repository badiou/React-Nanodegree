# Side Effect Cleanup

In this exercise, you'll practice using the `useEffect` hook with cleanup. To begin:

1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. Run `npm start` to start the development server.
3. Visit `http://localhost:3001/` and demo the application. Be sure than the console is open (i.e., in Chrome DevTools if using Chrome).
4. Open `./src/App.js` and examine how it works (you won't need to modify anything in this file).
5. Open `./src/CountdownTimer.js` and examine how it works.
6. Update the logic in the `useEffect` hook in `./src/CountdownTimer.js` to include side effect cleanup.
